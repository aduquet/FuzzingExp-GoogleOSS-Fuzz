# FuzzingExp-GoogleOSS-Fuzz
This repo explores Google OSS-Fuzz

Google uses fuzzing for all development of new components for their Chrome OS or browser. Having achieved great success in this way, the turned their fuzzer into an open source project, OSS-Fuzz.

OSS-Fuzz taps into several other fuzzing engines including AFL++, libFuzzer and Honggfuzz. It supports multiple languages including C, C++, Rust, Go, Python and Java/JVM code, though it notes that other languages may also work. It works with both x86-64 and i386 builds.

The OSS Fuzz program is one of the most highly rated on GitHub right now. It has a large community and lots of support in the open-source community.
